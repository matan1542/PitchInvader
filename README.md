## **Important Details**
### Define the players

You can define players as JSON, for example:
```js
{
    "id": 13,
    "positionType": "defender",
    "alternativePositions": "",
    "name": "Virgil van Dijk",
    "shirtNumber": 4
},
```

### **About Positions**
There are *4 types* of positions defined: 
1. goalkeeper
2. defender
3. midfielder
4. attacker

**positionType** must be one of the four above, this will be showed as the player's position.<br>
There are players in the world of football who can be used in different areas of the field, such as Joshua Kimmich. in this case, we would probably like to be able to put him in several areas of the pitch. This can be done with "**alternativePositions**", where you can list even more of the 4 position types just listed, separated by ",", "/" or ";". For example: 
```js
{
    "id": 1,
    "positionType": "defender",
    "alternativePositions": "midfielder/defender",
    "name": "Joshua Kimmich",
    "shirtNumber": 4
},
```

#### ***Important:***
* The **players id's have to be unique**, which means each player needs to have a different id
* The **player name should not be too long**, because it will spoil the user experience. It is recommended to write only the player's first and last name or abbreviate his name, for example, Mathys H. Tel.
* Shirt numbers must not be unique

## **Usage**
You need to install the package, import the "SquadBuilder" component and use it (the "SquadBuilder" component provides the pitch and the bench). It's exactly as simple as it sounds.

### Install the package via. npm
Enter this line in your terminal
```ps
npm i react-squad-builder
```

### Import the "SquadBuilder" component, in the file where you want to use the component
```jsx
import SquadBuilder from 'react-squad-builder'
```

### Define the players you want to include
```jsx
const players = [
    {
      "id": 1,                      // Id of the player, has to be unique
      "positionType": "goalkeeper", // The type of the player's position
                                    // (goalkeeper/defender/midfielder/attacker)
      "alternativePositions": "",   // additional positions can be listed separated by ", "/" or ";"
      "name": "Gianluigi Donnarumma",
      "shirtNumber": 21
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "positionType": "midfielder",
      "alternativePositions": "attacker",
      "name": "Dominik Szoboszlai",
      "shirtNumber": 8
    }
]
```

### In the same file use the component
```jsx
<SquadBuilder players={players} />
```

### The file should look something like this
```jsx
import SquadBuilder from 'react-squad-builder'

const YourComponent = () => {

  const players = [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "positionType": "goalkeeper",
      "alternativePositions": "",
      "name": "Gianluigi Donnarumma",
      "shirtNumber": 21
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "positionType": "midfielder",
      "alternativePositions": "attacker",
      "name": "Dominik Szoboszlai",
      "shirtNumber": 8
    }
  ]
  return (
    <SquadBuilder players={players} />
  )
}
export default YourComponent
```

## Customizations

### **Define deafult jersey colors**
This is the basic jersey coloring.

![Deafult jersey](./images/deafultJersey.jpg)

You are able to change the jersy's background color and the color of the text on the jersy by defining the "defaultJerseyColor" or the "defaultJerseyTextColor"

Example:
```jsx
 <SquadBuilder players={players} defaultJerseyColor={"rgb(0,0,0)"} defaultJerseyTextColor={"#FFFF00"}/>
```
As the example shows, you can use both "rgb" and "hex" to define the default color
(User is able to change these colors in the built in "settings")

Now the jersey look like this by default:

![Deafult jersey](./images/deafultJersey2.jpg)

### **Define deafult "formation text" color**
By default, the library does not contain any background color, so the color of the "Pick a formation" text has a black color so that it appears on a white background. But it often happens that we want to place the component on a background of a different color, and then the text is not visible. Therefore, it is possible to set the color of the "Pick a formation" text to a default color.

![Pick a formation](./images/pickFormation.jpg)

You can define a default color with the prop "formationTextColor"

For example: 
```jsx
<SquadBuilder players={players} formationTextColor="#FF0000" lang="en"/>
```
![Pick a formation](./images/pickFormationRed.jpg)

### **Define deafult language**
There are 2 languages available currently for the library (English/Hungarian)
By deafult if "*lang*" is not provided when using "SquadBuilder" the app infers the user's language.

For example, you can set the language to English:
```jsx
<SquadBuilder players={players} lang={"en"}/>
```
Or you can set the language to Hungarian:

```jsx
<SquadBuilder players={players} lang={"hu"}/>
```
